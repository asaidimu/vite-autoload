## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: LTS version (e.g., 20.x or higher). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Bun**: Recommended package manager for this project. Install Bun from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

### Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    You can use `git clone` or `degit` for a fresh copy without the git history.

    Using `degit` (recommended for templates):
    ```bash
    bunx degit asaidimu/uistart my-react-app
    cd my-react-app
    ```
    Or using `git clone`:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/asaidimu/uistart.git my-react-app
    cd my-react-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `bun` as its package manager.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Verify Installation:**
    Start the development server to ensure everything is set up correctly.
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

---

## üìñ Usage Documentation

This section covers the essential commands and common workflows for developing with this template.

### Development Server

To start the local development server with hot module replacement:

```bash
bun run dev
```
This will open your application in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173`. Any changes you save will instantly reflect in the browser without a manual refresh.

**Note**: The `vite.config.ts` currently sets a `base: "/uistart/"` for deployment to a sub-path. If you intend to deploy to the root of your domain, remember to change this back to `base: "/"`.

### Building for Production

To build the optimized production-ready bundle of your application:

```bash
bun run build
```
This command first executes `tsc -b` to compile your TypeScript code, then uses Vite to bundle your assets, and finally outputs them to the `dist` directory. The build is highly optimized for performance and includes minification, tree-shaking, and code splitting.

### Code Linting

To check your codebase for linting errors and enforce coding standards:

```bash
bun run lint
```
This project uses ESLint 9.x with configurations for TypeScript, React, and React Hooks to ensure code quality and consistency across the project.

### Adding Shadcn UI Components

Shadcn UI components are not installed as traditional NPM packages but are added directly into your project's `src/components/ui` directory, allowing for easy customization.

To add a new Shadcn UI component (e.g., `button`):

```bash
bunx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```
This command will prompt you to configure the component (e.g., choose where to add it, if you want types, etc.). Ensure your `components.json` is correctly configured (which it is by default in this template) to use the correct paths and style settings.

Refer to the [Shadcn UI documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button) for a list of available components and their usage.

### Path Aliases

This template is configured with a path alias `@/` for the `src` directory, allowing for cleaner and more absolute imports.

Instead of:
```typescript
import { Button } from '../../components/ui/button';
// or assuming root 'src' from project root
import { Button } from './src/components/ui/button';
```

You can use the alias:
```typescript
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
```
This alias is configured in `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, and `vite.config.ts`. Additionally, `components.json` leverages these aliases for Shadcn UI component generation (e.g., `"components": "@/components", "utils": "@/lib/utils", "ui": "@/components/ui"`).

### Folder Structure (Conceptual)

The project follows a logical separation of concerns:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/                 # Static assets (e.g., vite.svg)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                    # All application source code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                # Main application entry point (e.g., app.tsx, index.html references src/app/app.tsx)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/             # Static assets like images, global CSS (app.css as configured in components.json)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/         # Reusable React components
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/             # Shadcn UI components (copied here via bunx shadcn-ui add)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/              # Custom React hooks
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                # Utility functions, helpers (e.g., utils.ts for tailwind-merge/clsx)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .eslintrc.js            # ESLint configuration for code quality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bun.lockb               # Bun's lockfile for deterministic dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components.json         # Shadcn UI configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json            # Project dependencies and scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tailwind.config.ts      # Tailwind CSS configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.app.json       # TypeScript configuration for the application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json           # Root TypeScript configuration, referencing app and node configs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.node.json      # TypeScript configuration for Node.js environment files (e.g., vite.config.ts)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vite.config.ts          # Vite build configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Extension Points

*   **Shadcn UI Customization**: Modify component styles directly within `src/components/ui` as they are part of your codebase, or update your `tailwind.config.ts` for theme changes. The `components.json` also allows global style changes like `new-york` theme or `baseColor`.
*   **Tailwind CSS Configuration**: Extend Tailwind's default theme, add custom utilities, or configure plugins in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **Vite Configuration**: Adjust build processes, add new Vite plugins, or modify development server settings in `vite.config.ts`. The `base` option for deployment paths is a common point of adjustment.
*   **ESLint Configuration**: Modify or extend linting rules in `.eslintrc.js` to enforce specific coding styles or best practices.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

### Troubleshooting

*   **"command not found: bun"**: Ensure Bun is correctly installed and its executable directory is added to your system's PATH environment variable.
*   **Dependency Issues**: If you face issues with dependencies (e.g., corrupted cache or mismatched versions), try clearing Bun's cache and reinstalling:
    ```bash
    bun install --force
    # Or, if you use npm-check-updates for version upgrades:
    # bunx npm-check-updates -u && bun install
    ```
*   **Tailwind CSS Not Applying Styles**:
    *   Double-check your `tailwind.config.ts` for correct `content` paths that cover all your source files.
    *   Ensure `src/assets/app.css` (or your main CSS file) includes the `@tailwind` directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`).
    *   Verify that `tailwind.config.ts` is correctly imported and passed to the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin in `vite.config.ts`.
*   **TypeScript Errors in IDE/Editor**: Ensure your IDE or editor (e.g., VS Code) is using the project's locally installed TypeScript version and that all dependencies are installed. Restarting the TypeScript server in your editor often resolves temporary issues.

### FAQ

*   **How do I update Shadcn UI components?**
    You can manually update individual components by running `bunx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>` again. This will prompt you to overwrite existing files, effectively updating them.
*   **Can I change the theme or colors of Shadcn UI components?**
    Yes, Shadcn UI integrates tightly with Tailwind CSS custom properties. You can modify the base colors and other theme aspects by adjusting values in your `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/assets/app.css` (specifically the `--<color>-<shade>` CSS variables).
*   **Is React Server Components (RSC) supported in this template?**
    No, this template is configured for client-side rendering. The `components.json` explicitly sets `"rsc": false`, indicating that it's set up for traditional React client applications.

### Changelog & Roadmap

*   **Changelog**: Refer to the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed history of changes (to be created).
*   **Roadmap**:
    *   Integrate a testing framework (e.g., Vitest + React Testing Library) with example tests.
    *   Add examples of common UI patterns and components demonstrating best practices.
    *   Expand comprehensive documentation for each integrated technology within the context of this template.
    *   Explore adding state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, Jotai) as optional integrations.
